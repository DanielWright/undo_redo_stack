What is this?
-------------

This is intended as a gentle introduction to TDD/BDD for people who have not
experienced it before. The idea is to implement a simple Undo/Redo stack as
can be found in any text editor. We all know how those work, so you can focus
on letting the tests drive the implementation. This should be a fairly short
exercise.

You could start by using your TDD'ed implementation from [here](https://github.com/hgimenez/stack).
Do that exercise first if you haven't already.
